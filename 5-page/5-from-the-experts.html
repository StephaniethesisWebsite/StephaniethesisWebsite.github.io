            >Allison: I would recommend starting small and concrete rather than vague and global. Rather than saying, I
            do too much, like, you need to help out more, I think starting small and figuring out exactly what are the
            tasks or areas where you feel like you&#39;re holding the load.<br /><br />Let’s just say, hypothetically,
            laundry is really burdensome to you. You don&#39;t like monitoring the hamper or you don&#39;t want to be
            the one to have to remind people to put their clothes away. Then I would approach your partner and saying,
            I</span
          ><span class="span2-d4Raop abcdiatypeedu-regularitalic-normal-black-24px">
            feel overwhelmed. I feel stressed, I feel annoyed. Here&#39;s where this is coming from. Would you be

          ><span class="span3-d4Raop abcdiatypeedu-regular-normal-black-24px"
            ><br />And assuming they are willing, then thinking very carefully about exactly what is entailed in
            laundry. I think the mistake a lot of people make is is not specifying or recognizing how many steps there
            are. So it&#39;s important to say, Okay, I want you to take over laundry. That means that you look at the
            hampers on a daily basis and see if they&#39;re overflowing, that means that you keep track of when our kids
            have soccer practice and make sure that their uniform is clean for Saturday practice. That means that you
            tell the shopper that we&#39;re running low on detergent, so we need to re-up. Just carefully kind of
            talking through what&#39;s entailed in that task and handing over the whole thing, not just one discrete
            task of,&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you do laundry tomorrow? But rather, can you can you be in charge of laundry and all
            that it entails? That&#39;s probably how I would approach it. I also think It&#39;s important to give your
            partner space to do it in their own way.</span

          Allison: In sociological literature on housework, there’s this idea called the relative resources hypothesis.
          The idea is that the person who earns more gets to kind of bargain their way out of housework, because
          they&#39;re contributing monetarily. So it&#39;s a key idea in the literature about, Why does this actually
          happen? It&#39;s slightly different when it comes to what couples say. <br /><br />I do hear from couples that
          he or she is earning more money, that they&#39;re the breadwinner. I hear more often though about the specific
          demands of the job. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;he just can&#39;t check his personal email in the middle of the
          workday, or he has to be on call after hours, or, something about the demand, the lack of flexibility, the
          number of hours, and the length of the commute. Those circumstantial factors come up a lot when people are
          explaining why they divide things as they do. <br /><br />I think each couple should make deliberate choices
          that match their values, their circumstances, their preferences, etc. The problem, in my mind, is that the
          same circumstances get applied unequally, depending on gender. So for instance, I have a number of female
          breadwinners in my sample. And some of their husband’s takes the “female role”, but in a lot of them, the
          women just end up doing both [breadwinning and caregiving]. And so the narrative will be, She’s just, so
          competent. She’s a super woman at work and at home. She&#39;s so organized. Whereas with men, the narrative is
          much more often, he just uses it all up at work and has nothing left at home. <br /><br />So I question
          whether the circumstances are quite as constraining as people sometimes make them out to be. I think
          there&#39;s interaction with deep seated ideas about what is possible for women.

            >Allison: When I was doing my interviews, I would ask people, before you had your first kid or became
            parents, did you talk about how the transition to parenthood might impact your career? Your division of
            labor? Did you make plans about how you would divide up the new childcare work? Most people say, No, we just
            thought it would kind of work out. We weren&#39;t talking about who was gonna be doing what with this baby.
            How it would change us. <br /><br />I&#39;m thinking about it a lot more than your average person because
            this is what I do for work, but it was really striking how many people slid into patterns, rather than
            mindfully planning for them. And often when I’m advising couples, or just talking to people informally,
            it&#39;s interesting to me how they&#39;ll explain something to me. They&#39;ll say, </span
          ><span class="span2-SOqKyM abcdiatypeedu-regularitalic-normal-black-24px">Here&#39;s the problem</span
          ><span class="span3-SOqKyM abcdiatypeedu-regular-normal-black-24px">
            and often, they haven&#39;t really expressed that to their partner. There&#39;s a lot wrapped up in that
            fear of conflict. So, the piece of advice I probably give most often is to not default into something but to
            make active decisions as much as you can. It&#39;s more work in the moment but I think it serves you
            well.</span
