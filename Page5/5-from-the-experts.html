          Q. What advice would you give to people who want to broach this of cognitive labor with their partner, without
          it being contentious or accusatory about the division of labor in their home?
        </div>
        <div class="a1">
          Allison: I would recommend starting small and concrete rather than vague and global. Rather than saying, I do
          too much, like, you need to help out more, I think starting small and figuring out exactly what are the tasks
          or areas where you feel like you&#39;re holding the load.<br /><br />Let’s just say, hypothetically, laundry
          is really burdensome to you. You don&#39;t like monitoring the hamper or you don&#39;t want to be the one to
          have to remind people to put their clothes away. Then I would approach your partner and saying, I feel
          overwhelmed. I feel stressed, I feel annoyed. Here&#39;s where this is coming from. Would you be willing to
          take some of that on? <br /><br />And assuming they are willing, then thinking very carefully about exactly
          what is entailed in laundry. I think the mistake a lot of people make is is not specifying or recognizing how
          many steps there are. So it&#39;s important to say, Okay, I want you to take over laundry. That means that you
          look at the hampers on a daily basis and see if they&#39;re overflowing, that means that you keep track of
          when our kids have soccer practice and make sure that their uniform is clean for Saturday practice. That means
          that you tell the shopper that we&#39;re running low on detergent, so we need to re-up. Just carefully kind of
          talking through what&#39;s entailed in that task and handing over the whole thing, not just one discrete task
          of,&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you do laundry tomorrow? But rather, can you can you be in charge of laundry and all that
          it entails? That&#39;s probably how I would approach it. I also think It&#39;s important to give your partner
          space to do it in their own way.

        <div class="q2 freighttextpro-bookitalic-normal-coral-42px">
          Q. In your research, how does being the&nbsp;&nbsp;“breadwinner” and earning more money in the
          relationship account for how people divide their household labor ?
        </div>
        <div class="a2 abcdiatypeedu-regular-normal-black-24px">
          Allison: In sociological literature on housework, there’s this idea called the relative resources hypothesis.
          The idea is that the person who earns more gets to kind of bargain their way out of housework, because
          they&#39;re contributing monetarily. So it&#39;s a key idea in the literature about, Why does this actually
          happen? It&#39;s slightly different when it comes to what couples say. <br /><br />I do hear from couples that
          he or she is earning more money, that they&#39;re the breadwinner. I hear more often though about the specific
          demands of the job. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;he just can&#39;t check his personal email in the middle of the
          workday, or he has to be on call after hours, or, something about the demand, the lack of flexibility, the
          number of hours, and the length of the commute. Those circumstantial factors come up a lot when people are
          explaining why they divide things as they do. <br /><br />I think each couple should make deliberate choices
          that match their values, their circumstances, their preferences, etc. The problem, in my mind, is that the
          same circumstances get applied unequally, depending on gender. So for instance, I have a number of female
          breadwinners in my sample. And some of their husband’s takes the “female role”, but in a lot of them, the
          women just end up doing both [breadwinning and caregiving]. And so the narrative will be, She’s just, so
          competent. She’s a super woman at work and at home. She&#39;s so organized. Whereas with men, the narrative is
          much more often, he just uses it all up at work and has nothing left at home. <br /><br />So I question
          whether the circumstances are quite as constraining as people sometimes make them out to be. I think
          there&#39;s interaction with deep seated ideas about what is possible for women.
        </div>
        <div class="q3 freighttextpro-bookitalic-normal-coral-42px">
          Q. What’s the most surprising insight <br />you discovered over the course of your research around cognitive
          load?
        </div>
        <div class="a3">
          Allison: When I was doing my interviews, I would ask people, before you had your first kid or became parents,
          did you talk about how the transition to parenthood might impact your career? Your division of labor? Did you
          make plans about how you would divide up the new childcare work? Most people say, No, we just thought it would
          kind of work out. We weren&#39;t talking about who was gonna be doing what with this baby. How it would change
          us. <br /><br />I&#39;m thinking about it a lot more than your average person because this is what I do for
          work, but it was really striking how many people slid into patterns, rather than mindfully planning for them.
          And often when I’m advising couples, or just talking to people informally, it&#39;s interesting to me how
          they&#39;ll explain something to me. They&#39;ll say, Here&#39;s the problem and often, they haven&#39;t
          really expressed that to their partner. There&#39;s a lot wrapped up in that fear of conflict. So, the piece
          of advice I probably give most often is to not default into something but to make active decisions as much as
          you can. It&#39;s more work in the moment but I think it serves you well.
